# About
In my previous life, I was a registered nurse with a passion in statistics.

Right now, I am a health data analyst based in Melbourne.

In my next life, I hope to become a comedian... 

This is a space for me to record my learnings along this journey, and keep some funny jokes (梗）for my next life.
